// Given two integer arrays A and B, return the maximum length of an subarray that appears in both arrays.
//
//     Example 1:
// Input:
//     A: [1,2,3,2,1]
// B: [3,2,1,4,7]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
//     The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
//     Note:
// 1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
// 0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100
